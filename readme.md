Exercise 2
---
Added dummy text to top and bottom of accordion so can see the auto scroll to opened content on mobile.

`('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()`

The 3rd + attempts to do the maths version of plus and since the following 'a' is not a number, it results to NaN (not a number).

`b + a + NaN + a` to lower case becomes `banana`
